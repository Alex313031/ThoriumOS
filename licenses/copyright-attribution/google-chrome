Google Chrome may include one or more components provided by Adobe Systems Incorporated and Adobe Software Ireland Limited (collectively, “Adobe”). Your use of the Adobe software, as provided by Google (“Adobe Software”), is subject to the following additional terms (the “Adobe Terms”). You, the entity receiving the Adobe Software, will be hereinafter referred to as “Sublicensee”.

1. License Restrictions.

(a) Flash Player, Version 10.x is designed only as a browser plug-in. Sublicensee may not modify or distribute this Adobe Software for use as anything but a browser plug-in for playing back content on a web page. For example, Sublicensee will not modify this Adobe Software in order to allow interoperation with applications that run outside the browser (e.g. stand-alone applications, widgets, device UI).

(b) Sublicensee will not expose any APIs of the Flash Player, Version 10.x through a browser plug-in interface in such a way that allows such extension to be used to play back content from a web page as a stand-alone application.

(c) The Chrome-Reader Software may not be used to render any PDF or EPUB documents that utilise digital-rights management protocols or systems other than Adobe DRM.

(d) Adobe DRM must be enabled in the Chrome-Reader Software for all Adobe DRM-protected PDF and EPUB documents.

(e) The Chrome-Reader Software may not, other than as explicitly permitted by the technical specifications, disable any capabilities provided by Adobe in the Adobe Software, including, but not limited to, support for PDF and EPUB formats and Adobe DRM.

2. Electronic Transmission. Sublicensee may allow the download of the Adobe Software from a website, the Internet, an intranet or similar technology (“Electronic Transmissions”), provided that Sublicensee agrees that any distributions of the Adobe Software by Sublicensee, including those on CD-ROM, DVD-ROM or other storage media and Electronic Transmissions, if expressly permitted, shall be subject to reasonable security measures to prevent unauthorised use. With relation to Electronic Transmissions approved hereunder, Sublicensee agrees to employ any reasonable usage restrictions set by Adobe, including those related to security and/or the restriction of distribution to end users of the Sublicensee's Product.

4. Open Source. Sublicensee will not directly or indirectly grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights or immunities under Adobe’s intellectual property or proprietary rights that will subject such intellectual property to an open-source licence or scheme in which there is, or could be interpreted to be, a requirement that as a condition of use, modification and/or distribution, the Adobe Software be: (i) disclosed or distributed in source code form; (ii) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or (iii) redistributable at no charge. For clarification purposes, the foregoing restriction does not preclude Sublicensee from distributing, and Sublicensee will distribute the Adobe Software as bundled with the Google Software, without charge.

5. Additional Terms. With respect to any update, upgrade, new versions of the Adobe Software (collectively “Upgrades”) provided to Sublicenses, Adobe reserves the right to require additional terms and conditions applicable solely to the Upgrade and future versions thereof, and solely to the extent that such restrictions are imposed by Adobe on all licensees of such Upgrade. If Sublicensee does not agree to such additional terms or conditions, Sublicensee will have no licence rights with respect to such Upgrade, and Sublicensee’s licence rights with respect to the Adobe Software will terminate automatically on the 90th day from the date that such additional terms are made available to Sublicensee.

6. Proprietary Rights Notices. The Sublicensee shall not, and shall require its distributors not to, delete or in any manner alter the copyright notices, trademarks, logos or related notices, or other proprietary rights notices of Adobe (and its licensors, if any) appearing on or within the Adobe Software or accompanying materials.

8. Verification and Update. Sublicensee must submit to Adobe each Sublicensee product (and each version thereof) containing the Adobe Software and/or Upgrade (“Sublicensee Product”) that do not meet the Device Verification exemption criteria to be communicated by Google, for Adobe to verify. Sublicensee shall pay for each submission made by Sublicensee by procuring verification packages at Adobe’s then-current terms set forth at http://flashmobile.adobe.com/. Sublicensee Product that has not passed verification may not be distributed. Verification will be accomplished in accordance with Adobe’s then-current process described at http://flashmobile.adobe.com/ (“Verification”).

9. Profiles and Device Central. Sublicensee will be prompted to enter certain profile information about the Sublicensee Products either as part of the Verification process or some other method, and Sublicensee will provide such information, to Adobe. Adobe may (i) use such profile information as reasonably necessary to verify the Sublicensee Product (if such product is subject to Verification), and (ii) display such profile information in “Adobe Device Intelligence system”, located at https://devices.adobe.com/partnerportal/, and made available through Adobe’s authoring and development tools and services to enable developers and end users to see how content or applications are displayed in Sublicensee Products (e.g. how video images appear in certain phones).

10. Export. Sublicensee acknowledges that the laws and regulations of the United States restrict the export and re-export of commodities and technical data of United States origin, which may include the Adobe Software. Sublicensee agrees that it will not export or re-export the Adobe Software without the appropriate United States and foreign governmental clearances, if any.

11. Technology Pass-through Terms.

(a) Except pursuant to applicable permissions or agreements therefore, from or with the applicable parties, Sublicensees shall not use and shall not allow the use of, the Adobe Software for the encoding or decoding of mp3 audio only (.mp3) data on any non-pc device (e.g. mobile phone or set-top box), nor may the mp3 encoders or decoders contained in the Adobe Software be used or accessed by any product other than the Adobe Software. The Adobe Software may be used for the encoding or decoding of MP3 data contained within a swf or flv file, which contains video, picture or other data. Sublicensee shall acknowledge that use of the Adobe Software for non-PC devices, as described in the prohibitions in this section, may require the payment of licensing royalties or other amounts to third parties who may hold intellectual property rights related to the MP3 technology and that Adobe nor Sublicensee has not paid any royalties or other amounts on account of third party intellectual property rights for such use. If Sublicensee requires an MP3 encoder or decoder for such use, Sublicensee is responsible for obtaining the necessary intellectual property license, including any applicable patent rights.

(b) Sublicensee will not use, copy, reproduce and modify (i) the On2 source code (provided hereunder as a component of the Source Code) as necessary to enable the Adobe Software to decode video in the Flash video file format (.flv or .f4v), and (ii) the Sorenson Spark source code (provided hereunder as a component of the Source Code) for the limited purpose of making bug fixes and performance enhancements to the Adobe Software. All codecs provided with the Adobe Software may only be used and distributed as an integrated part of the Adobe Software and may not be accessed by any other application, including other Google applications.

(c) The Source Code may be provided with an AAC codec and/or HE-AAC codec (“the AAC Codec”). Use of the AAC Codec is conditioned on Sublicensee obtaining a proper patent licence covering necessary patents as provided by VIA Licensing, for end products on or in which the AAC Codec will be used. Sublicensee acknowledges and agrees that Adobe is not providing a patent licence for an AAC Codec under this Agreement to Sublicensee or its sublicensees.

(d) THE SOURCE CODE MAY CONTAIN CODE LICENSED UNDER THE AVC PATENT PORTFOLIO LICENCE FOR THE PERSONAL NON-COMMERCIAL USE OF A CONSUMER TO (i) ENCODE VIDEO IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE AVC STANDARD ("AVC VIDEO") AND/OR (ii) DECODE AVC VIDEO THAT WAS ENCODED BY A CONSUMER ENGAGED IN A PERSONAL NON-COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY AND/OR WAS OBTAINED FROM A VIDEO PROVIDER LICENSED TO PROVIDE AVC VIDEO.

The Sublicensee will list the Adobe Software in publicly available Sublicensee Product specifications and include appropriate Adobe Software branding (specifically excluding the Adobe corporate logo) on the Sublicensee Product packaging or marketing materials in a manner consistent with branding of other third-party products contained within the Sublicensee Product.

14. No Warranty. THE ADOBE SOFTWARE IS MADE AVAILABLE TO SUBLICENSEE FOR USE AND REPRODUCTION “AS IS” AND ADOBE MAKES NO WARRANTY AS TO ITS USE OR PERFORMANCE. ADOBE AND ITS SUPPLIERS DO NOT AND CANNOT WARRANT THE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS OBTAINED BY USING THE ADOBE SOFTWARE. EXCEPT FOR ANY WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION OR TERM TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE SAME CANNOT OR MAY NOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY LAW APPLICABLE TO SUBLICENSEE IN SUBLICENSEE’S JURISDICTION, ADOBE AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, OR TERMS (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WHETHER BY STATUTE, COMMON LAW, CUSTOM, USAGE OR OTHERWISE) AS TO ANY MATTER INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, MERCHANTABILITY, INTEGRATION, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. SUBLICENSEE AGREES THAT SUBLICENSEE SHALL NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ON BEHALF OF ADOBE.

15. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL ADOBE OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO SUBLICENSEE FOR ANY DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS WHATSOEVER OR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST SAVINGS, EVEN IF AN ADOBE REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS, DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY THIRD PARTY. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN SUBLICENSEE’S JURISDICTION. ADOBE’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS (US$1,000). Nothing contained in this Agreement limits Adobe’s liability to Sublicensee in the event of death or personal injury resulting from Adobe’s negligence or for the tort of deceit (fraud). Adobe is acting on behalf of its suppliers for the purpose of disclaiming, excluding and/or limiting obligations, warranties and liability as provided in this Agreement, but in no other respects and for no other purpose.

16. Content Protection Terms

(a) Definitions.

“Compliance and Robustness Rules” means the document setting forth compliance and robustness rules for the Adobe Software located at http://www.adobe.com/mobile/licensees, or a successor website thereto.

“Content Protection Functions” means those aspects of the Adobe Software that are designed to ensure compliance with the Compliance and Robustness Rules, and to prevent playback, copying, modification, redistribution or other actions with respect to digital content distributed for consumption by users of the Adobe Software when such actions are not authorised by the owners of such digital content or its licensed distributors.

“Content Protection Code” means code within certain designated versions of the Adobe Software that enables certain Content Protection Functions.

“Key” means a cryptographic value contained in the Adobe Software for use in decrypting digital content.

(b) Licence Restrictions. Sublicensee’s right to exercise the licences with respect to the Adobe Software is subject to the following additional restrictions and obligations. Sublicensee will ensure that Sublicensee’s customers comply with these restrictions and obligations to the same extent imposed on Sublicensee with respect to the Adobe Software; any failure by Sublicensee’s customers to comply with these additional restrictions and obligations shall be treated as a material breach by Sublicensee.

b.1. (b.1) The Sublicensee and customers may only distribute the Adobe Software that meets the Robustness and Compliance Rules as so confirmed by the Sublicensee during the verification process described above in the Adobe Terms.

b.2. Sublicensee shall not (i) circumvent the Content Protection Functions of either the Adobe Software or any related Adobe Software that is used to encrypt or decrypt digital content for authorised consumption by users of the Adobe Software or (ii) develop or distribute products that are designed to circumvent the Content Protection Functions of either the Adobe Software or any Adobe Software that is used to encrypt or decrypt digital content for authorised consumption by users of the Adobe Software.

(c) The Keys are hereby designated as Adobe’s Confidential Information, and Sublicensee will, with respect to the Keys, adhere to Adobe’s Source Code Handling Procedure (to be provided by Adobe upon request).

(d) Injunctive Relief. Sublicensee agrees that a breach of this Agreement may compromise the Content Protection Functions of the Adobe Software and may cause unique and lasting harm to the interests of Adobe and owners of digital content that rely on such Content Protection Functions, and that monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate fully for such harm. Therefore, Sublicensee further agrees that Adobe may be entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent or limit the harm caused by any such breach, in addition to monetary damages.

17. Intended Third-party Beneficiary. Adobe Systems Incorporated and Adobe Software Ireland Limited are the intended third-party beneficiaries of Google’s agreement with Sublicensee with respect to the Adobe Software, including but not limited to, the Adobe Terms. Sublicensee agrees, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in its agreement with Google, that Google may disclose Sublicensee’s identity to Adobe and certify in writing that Sublicensee has entered into a licence agreement with Google that includes the Adobe Terms. Sublicensee must have an agreement with each of its licensees and if such licensees are allowed to redistribute the Adobe Software, such agreement will include the Adobe Terms.
